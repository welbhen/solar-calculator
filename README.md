# Solar Calculator
Estimates an energy generation for a specific location based on geographic coordinates and average electricity usage (kWh/month)
and shows a monthly expected generation value and graph, alongside the average monthly GHI (Global Horizontal Irradiance).

This is a real solar system estimator and not just a study app for coding purposes.

I'm using NREL solar irradiance API.
